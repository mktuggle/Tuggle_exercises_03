## Setting up on GitHub!

Before starting your assignment, you need to get yourself set up on GitHub and make sure GitHub is connected to R Studio. To do that, you should read the instruction (through the "Cloning a repo" section) and watch the video [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md). Then, do the following (if you get stuck on a step, don't worry, I will help! You can always get started on the homework and we can figure out the GitHub piece later):

* Create a repository on GitHub, giving it a nice name so you know it is for the 3rd weekly exercise assignment (follow the instructions in the document/video).  
* Copy the repo name so you can clone it to your computer. In R Studio, go to file --> New project --> Version control --> Git and follow the instructions from the document/video.  
* Download the code from this document and save it in the repository folder/project on your computer.  
* In R Studio, you should then see the .Rmd file in the upper right corner in the Git tab (along with the .Rproj file and probably .gitignore).  
* Check all the boxes of the files in the Git tab and choose commit.  
* In the commit window, write a commit message, something like "Initial upload" would be appropriate, and commit the files.  
* Either click the green up arrow in the commit window or close the commit window and click the green up arrow in the Git tab to push your changes to GitHub.   
* Refresh your GitHub page (online) and make sure the new documents have been pushed out.  
* Back in R Studio, knit the .Rmd file. When you do that, you should have two (as long as you didn't make any changes to the .Rmd file, in which case you might have three) files show up in the Git tab - an .html file and an .md file. The .md file is something we haven't seen before and is here because I included `keep_md: TRUE` in the YAML heading. The .md file is a markdown (NOT R Markdown) file that is an interim step to creating the html file. They are displayed fairly nicely in GitHub, so we want to keep it and look at it there. Click the boxes next to these two files, commit changes (remember to include a commit message), and push them (green up arrow).  
* As you work through your homework, save and commit often, push changes occasionally (maybe after you feel finished with an exercise?), and go check to see what the .md file looks like on GitHub.  
* If you have issues, let me know! This is new to many of you and may not be intuitive at first. But, I promise, you'll get the hang of it! 



## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week. Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(day = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, day) %>% 
  summarise(total_wt = sum(weight)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = day,
              values_from = total_wt)
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the `plot` variable from the `plant_date_loc` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, variety) %>% 
  summarise(tot_wt_g = sum(weight)) %>% 
  mutate(tot_wt_lb = tot_wt_g*0.00220462) %>% 
  left_join(plant_date_loc,
            by = "vegetable", "variety")
```

As some of the same varieties were planted on different days and plots, the number of rows is much longer than the plant_date_loc dataset, as the variety (and their total weight) is often repeated several times. Since I was unable to figure out how to add just the plot variable, and not the other matching variables from 'plant_date_loc,' summarizing the varieties in the 'plant_date_loc' data to the latest date or even just filtering/selecting only the plot, vegetable, and variety into a new, smaller dataset may be helpful. I'm not sure if it would make sense, but also possibly pivoting the plots into columns, to try and cut down on the varieties repeating. 

  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `supply_cost` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.

Using the `garden_harvest` and `supply_cost` datasets, you could use a mutating join and add a variable calculating the amount spent on each vegetable variety (from the supply costs) per pound (or gram) harvested. This new variable could then be compared to the cost per pound (or calculated to gram if you like) for the same or comparable vegetable varieties listed on Whole Food's website.

  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  filter(vegetable %in% c("tomatoes")) %>% 
  group_by(variety, date) %>% 
  summarise(first_harvest = min(date), tot_wt_lb = sum(weight*0.00220462)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tot_wt_lb, y = variety), 
         fct_reorder(variety, first_harvest, min)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Total Harvest (lb)", 
       y = "Tomato Variety")
```

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  
```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  mutate(lower_case = str_to_lower(variety),
         variety_name_length = str_length(variety)) %>% 
  arrange(variety_name_length) %>% 
  distinct(vegetable, variety, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  mutate(lower_case = str_to_lower(variety)) %>% 
  mutate(er_or_ar = str_detect(lower_case, "er|ar")) %>% 
  distinct(vegetable, variety, .keep_all = TRUE)
```


## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

<center>

![A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_station.jpg){300px}


![One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_van.jpg){300px}

</center>

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usually, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.

```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sdate)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Bike Rentals Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Density of Usage")
```
  
  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  group_by(sdate) %>% 
  mutate(hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute = minute(sdate)) %>% 
  mutate(time = (hour+minute/60))%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Density of Bike Rentals Throughout the Day",
       x = "Time (hr)",
       y = "Density of Usage")
```
  
  9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = day)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Bikes Rented by Day of the Week",
       x = "Bikes Rented",
       y = "Day")
```
  
  10. Facet your graph from exercise 8. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  group_by(sdate) %>% 
  mutate(hour = hour(sdate), 
         minute = minute(sdate),
         time = (hour+minute/60),
         day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(vars(day)) +
  labs(title = "Daily Bike Rentals Throughout the Week",
       x = "Time (hr)",
       y = "Density of Usage")
```
  
Both Sat and Sun have similar patterns of usage, both peaking around mid-afternoon, as more people aren't in work and exploring the city. The weekdays also share similar patterns, with peaks in the morning and afternoon/evening when people are likely commuting to and from work or other engagements.

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = day, fill = client)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5, color = NA) +
  labs(title = "Bikes Rented by Day of the Week",
       x = "Bikes Rented",
       y = "Day",
       fill = "Client")
```

  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = day, fill = client)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5, color = NA, 
               position = position_stack()) +
  labs(title = "Bikes Rented by Day of the Week",
       x = "Bikes Rented",
       y = "Day",
       fill = "Client")
```

I think that the previous graph may be slightly better at telling a story, as it's more compact and one can more easily see the differences between rentals on different days of the week.However, the overlap between the client colors somewhat obscures the distinction between them. On the other hand, this graph is more spread out, which at first glance doesn't quite show the same contrast between each day, but also allows us to clearly see the values and differences between the rental patterns of client types.

  13. Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(weekend = ifelse(wday(sdate, label = TRUE) %in% c("Sat", "Sun"),
         "Weekend", "Weekday")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = weekday, fill = client)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5, color = NA, 
               position = position_stack()) +
  facet_wrap(vars(weekend)) +
  labs(title = "Bikes Rented by Day of the Week",
       x = "Bikes Rented",
       y = "Day",
       fill = "Client")
```
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(weekend = ifelse(wday(sdate, label = TRUE) %in% c("Sat", "Sun"),
         "Weekend", "Weekday")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = weekday, fill = weekday)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5, color = NA, 
               position = position_stack()) +
  facet_wrap(vars(client)) +
  labs(title = "Bikes Rented by Day of the Week",
       x = "Bikes Rented",
       y = "Day",
       fill = "Weekday")
```

This graph tells us that while casual and registered clients rent bikes at similar rates, registered clients rent bikes just slightly more, especially on Mondays and throughout the week. There are always a lot of rentals on Sun, regardless of whether the client is registered or casual. I think the second graph may be slightly better, as it more clearly gives you information about both the rental patterns and usage on weekdays and weekends. The first graph has a more direct representation of the difference between weekday and weekend renting, but in my opinion isn't quite as clear as the 2nd graph on the differences between casual and registered clients.

### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  left_join(Stations,
            by = c("sstation"="name")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, size = sstation)) +
  geom_count(position = "jitter") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Latitude", y = "Longitude")
```
  
  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  left_join(Stations,
            by = c("sstation"="name")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, size = sstation, color = client)) +
  geom_count(position = "jitter") +
  guides(size = "none") +
  labs(x = "Latitude", 
       y = "Longitude",
       color = "Client")
```
  
### Spatiotemporal patterns

  17. Make a table with the ten station-date combinations (e.g., 14th & V St., 2014-10-14) with the highest number of departures, sorted from most departures to fewest. Save this to a new dataset and print out the dataset. Hint: `as_date(sdate)` converts `sdate` from date-time format to date format. 
  
```{r}
Departures <- Trips %>% 
  left_join(Stations,
            by = c("sstation"="name")) %>% 
  mutate(date_only = as_date(sdate),
         station_date = paste(sstation, date_only, 
                              sep = ", ")) %>% 
  add_count(station_date)
```

```{r}
TopTenStations <- Departures %>% 
  select(sdate, sstation, station_date, n) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  distinct(station_date, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  slice_max(n, n = 10, with_ties = FALSE)
```

```{r}
TopTenStations
```
  
  18. Use a join operation to make a table with only those trips whose departures match those top ten station-date combinations from the previous part.
  
```{r}
Departures %>% 
  semi_join(TopTenStations,
             by = "station_date")
```
  
  19. Build on the code from the previous problem (ie. copy that code below and then %>% into the next step.) and group the trips by client type and day of the week (use the name, not the number). Find the proportion of trips by day within each client type (ie. the proportions for all 7 days within each client type add up to 1). Display your results so day of week is a column and there is a column for each client type. Interpret your results.

**Note**: I know this problem is unfinished - I had a lot of trouble figuring out both where to start and how to express what I wanted to convey with code, so here's my best bet (I understand that I won't get the points but at this point I just need to finish this assignment and start figuring out next week's material. I'll be sure to check the solutions when they come out and do my best to work through it then!). I'm thinking I'm probably over thinking the code and that I may have gone wrong in 17 or 18 and that may be affecting the problems I'm having with this table. 

Here I was trying to create two new variables that showed the sum of rides taken by registered clients and casual clients. From there I was going to try and get the proportion by weekday, dividing the st_departures variable by 7 (?), and possibly by using the ifelse function to create the weekday columns. I feel like I was starting to get somewhere with the 'sum_registered' variable, it has different values for each day of the week, but I'm not sure how to either negate that filter and do another for casual clients, or achieve this without using filter there, as I tried a bunch of other things. From the previous graphs created comparing clients, I'm guessing that it will likely show a higher proportion of registered clients departing during the week, at stations closer to the city, and casual clients having a higher proportion of departures on weekends. 

```{r}
Departures %>% 
  semi_join(TopTenStations,
             by = "station_date") %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  rename(st_departures = n) %>%
  group_by(client, weekday) %>% 
  filter(client %in% c("Registered")) %>% 
  mutate(sum_registered = sum(st_departures))
```

## Challenge problem! 

This problem uses the data from the Tidy Tuesday competition this week, `kids`. If you need to refresh your memory on the data, read about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md). 

  21. In this exercise, you are going to try to replicate the graph below, created by Georgios Karamanis. I'm sure you can find the exact code on GitHub somewhere, but **DON'T DO THAT!** You will only be graded for putting an effort into this problem. So, give it a try and see how far you can get without doing too much googling. HINT: use `facet_geo()`. The graphic won't load below since it came from a location on my computer. So, you'll have to reference the original html on the moodle page to see it.
